  /** The id of one of this tune's *owner's own* `chordChartSongs` rows, if they've linked one —
      added for mobile's "link a chord chart to a tune" feature. Deliberately optional, with no
      Convex schema change behind it: a `Tune` round-trips as one opaque JSON blob inside
      `syncedSettings.value` (see `lib/useSyncedTunes.ts`), never validated field-by-field by
      Convex itself, so an old tune (or one saved from the web app, which doesn't set this field)
      simply doesn't have it — nothing to migrate, nothing that can break existing data. Only
      meaningful to the tune's own owner directly (it's a private library reference); a *public*
      view of a tune (`PublicTune` below) instead carries a fully-resolved `linkedChart` snapshot,
      not this raw id, so a viewer who doesn't own the referenced chart can still see it. */
