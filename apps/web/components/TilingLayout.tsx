/** One pane: the actual tool (mounted via `TOOL_COMPONENTS`), a small split button centered on
    each of its four edges (hover-revealed — `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`, the same
    reveal-on-hover convention `Sidebar.tsx`'s own favorite star already uses — so they don't
    clutter the tool's own UI the rest of the time), and an always-visible close button in the
    corner once there's more than one pane to collapse back into. Clicking an edge button doesn't
    open any UI of its own — per a direct follow-up request, it opens the exact same `/` command
    palette every other search in this app uses (`onRequestSplit`, implemented by `TilingLayout`
    below), rather than a bespoke mini-popover.

    There used to be an "active pane" accent ring here too, gated to only show once there's more
    than one pane — but even gated correctly, it kept being reported as an unwanted border (most
    recently specifically on Community/Account while genuinely tiled with a sibling, where it *was*
    behaving as designed), so it's been removed outright rather than re-tuned a third time; the
    sidebar already reflects which pane is active (`Sidebar.tsx`'s `NavItems`), so this wasn't the
    only way to tell. */

 * "Advanced layouts" — an opt-in tiling window manager for the main content area. Off by default
 * (`lib/useTilingLayout.ts`'s `enabled`); `AppShell.tsx` only ever mounts this component once
 * that's true *and* the screen is desktop-sized (that check lives in `AppShell`, not here — see
 * its own comment for why). Every pane renders its tool directly from `TOOL_COMPONENTS`, bypassing
 * the Next.js router entirely for the panes that aren't "the one matching the current URL" —
 * there's no way to have Next's own router simultaneously render several different routes' pages
 * at once, so this keeps its own tree of live, lazily-imported tool components instead, and only
 * *reflects* the active pane's href into the real URL (via `router.replace`, never `push` — tiling
 * around shouldn't flood the back button with history entries) so a copied link still opens the
 * right tool for whoever you send it to. That link only ever restores a single tool, never the
 * whole tiled arrangement — the arrangement itself is this browser's own `localStorage`,
 * deliberately not something encoded in the URL.
 *
 * The sidebar (and the `/` command palette, which navigates through the same Next.js router) stay
 * in sync *both* ways: this component's own navigation calls move the URL to match whichever pane
 * is active, and clicking a sidebar nav link or picking a result from `/` search retargets the
 * *active* pane's tool instead of doing nothing visible (Next still resolves that route's real
 * page into `children`, which `AppShell` ignores the whole time tiling is on, so without this a
 * click just silently went nowhere from the user's point of view). The `pathname`-watching effect
 * below is what closes that loop: it compares the live URL against the active pane's own href on
 * every render, and only ever acts when they've drifted apart — which happens from an outside
 * navigation, never from this component's own `router.replace` calls (those always set the URL to
 * exactly what the pane's href already just became), so there's no feedback loop.
 *
 * An edge button doesn't open any UI of its own — `requestPaneSplit` just records which pane and
 * which direction (`lib/useTilingLayout.ts`'s `requestSplit`) and opens the *real* `/` command
 * palette on the pane's behalf; `CommandPalette.tsx`'s own `go()` checks for that pending request
 * and performs the split instead of its usual navigation when one exists.

  // ("if i have 2 windows open... go back to the metronome it will refresh the window and the
  // metronome will stop"): focusing a different pane used to call `router.replace()` purely to
  // keep the address bar in sync, and that alone — regardless of which pane or tool — was traced
  // to remounting whichever `TOOL_COMPONENTS` entry the navigation targeted (confirmed with
  // instance-id tracing: `Pane`/`AppShell` stayed perfectly stable while the tool component
  // underneath got a fresh instance, losing all its state, exactly when and only when
  // `router.replace`/`push` targeted that tool's own href). Focus/close/split now update the
  // address bar via `syncAddressBar` (raw History API, bypassing Next's router entirely — see its
  // own doc comment) instead, which never triggers that remount, but also never updates Next's own
  // `usePathname()` — so comparing `pathname` against the active pane's href on *every* render
  // (including ones only triggered by `activePaneId` changing from a focus click) would misfire,
