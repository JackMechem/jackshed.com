// Every bar used to get its own separate `Renderer`/card; fixed into one continuous system per a
// direct follow-up ("bars should not be in separate containers... right next to each other in one
// line with nothing separating them"). That worked well up to a handful of bars, but a pattern
// that needs many (an 11- or 13-stroke roll can need 11-13 bars to realign with the bar line —
// see `lib/stickControl.ts`'s own `minimalBarsFor`) then had to squeeze onto one ever-shrinking
// line, reported back directly as illegible. Fixed again, this time with real line-wrapping: bars
// are grouped into *rows* of at most `MAX_BARS_PER_ROW`, each row rendered as its own continuous
// multi-bar system (reusing the exact same "abutting Staves on one shared canvas" approach the
// single-line version already used) and stacked vertically — real sheet music's own "system
// break" convention, not a one-off. How many bars actually fit in a row is measured against the
// container's own real width (via `ResizeObserver`, the same technique `ChordChart.tsx`'s
// `PageFit` already uses elsewhere in this app) using each bar's own already-measured natural
// width, capped at `MAX_BARS_PER_ROW` — "adjusting to screen size" in the literal sense: a wide
// desktop window gets up to 4 bars per row, a narrow phone gets fewer, whatever actually fits
