/** Account page's own "Posts" tab — every Community post the signed-in account has made
    (`communityTunes.mine`, uncapped, unlike `CommunityTunes.tsx`'s own browse list which is
    capped at the 60 most recent *across everyone*). Added per a direct, pointed correction: an
    earlier version of Community's own browse view had a Browse/My Posts toggle baked into it,
    which Jack called out directly (from the mobile app's identical screenshot — this page mirrors
    that same fix) as confusing — "my posts should be in the profile section of the app." Reuses
    `PostListItem` from `CommunityTunes.tsx` wholesale (clicking it opens the exact same `/post/
    [id]` full page Community itself uses), so a post looks and opens identically regardless of
    where you found it — only *where this list lives* changed, not how a post is rendered. Every
    row here is already the caller's own by construction (`mine` is scoped server-side), so delete
    is always offered, no `isMine` check needed the way the shared browse list has to do. */
