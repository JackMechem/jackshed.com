// The reference for this chart's look started as Finale's "Jazz Text" — a thin, plain jazz-chart
// serif bundled with Finale (MakeMusic's notation software), not something available for web use —
// approximated for a while with EB Garamond, then briefly with lilyjazz-text (the hand-written
// text face from the LilyJAZZ font family), before landing here: Petaluma, the SMuFL-compliant
// notation font family Steinberg built for Dorico. Two of its three faces are used together —
// `PetalumaScript` (a genuinely hand-inked-looking text face — root letters, digits, and most of
// the quality suffix) for everything `lilyjazz-text` was doing, plus `Petaluma` itself (the
// engraving/symbol face) for exactly two characters neither `PetalumaScript` nor any plain-text
// font actually has a real glyph for: a proper major-seventh triangle and a proper diminished
// circle. Unlike Δ/° set in an ordinary font (lilyjazz-text's own gap, and EB Garamond's before
// it), SMuFL fonts ship dedicated "chord symbol" glyphs purpose-built for exactly this — real
// engraved jazz-chord marks, not Greek/math characters standing in for them — at their own
// Private-Use-Area codepoints (`csymMajorSeventh` U+E873, `csymDiminished` U+E870; see
// `QualityText` below). `PetalumaScript` already covers ♯/♭/ø directly at their normal Unicode
// codepoints (confirmed by checking its actual cmap, not assumed), so `prettyQuality`'s existing
// Δ/ø/°/♯/♭ substitution is untouched and still shared with Guess the Chord — only Δ and ° get
// intercepted and re-rendered through the second face here, and only in this file. Licensed under
// the SIL Open Font License 1.1, copyright Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH
// (`components/fonts/petaluma/OFL.txt`), which permits exactly this bundling as long as the
// license text travels with it and the reserved name "Petaluma" isn't reused for a modified
// version; see `/credits` for the on-site attribution. Self-hosted via `next/font/local`
// (colocated next to this component, not under `public/`, per Next's own recommended colocation
// pattern) rather than `next/font/google`, since neither face is a Google Fonts entry. Both are
// single static OTF faces, so neither needs a `weight`/`style` declared. Loaded here, not the
// site-wide font list in app/fonts.ts, since it's specific to this one chart display.
//
// `PetalumaScript` reads as noticeably lighter-weight than lilyjazz-text on paper (thinner stroke
// contrast is part of its own design, not a CSS adjustment) — the family ships only this one
// weight of it, though, so there's no lighter cut to switch to if it still reads too heavy once
// actually seen rendered; a non-variable OTF's stroke weight can't be thinned further through CSS
// `font-weight` the way a variable font's could.

/** Renders one song's chord chart. Two different fit strategies, depending on context:

    - Normal (in-page): the chart always renders at *full container width* — never narrower —
      and grows however tall it needs to (`PageFit`'s `fitHeight={false}` mode). This replaced an
      earlier version that locked the page to a fixed `aspect-[8.5/11]` box: for a long chart
      (many rows), that fixed ratio made *height* the binding constraint on how much the whole
      thing could be scaled up, which then shrank the *width* right along with it — a long chart
      on a narrow phone ended up rendered at a fraction of the screen's actual width, with wasted
      margin on both sides, exactly the bug a direct follow-up reported ("long charts do this on
      mobile... the width should match the width of the screen"). Decoupling the two fixes it:
      width is always 100%, and the page simply grows taller for a longer chart (normal page
      scroll below it, if any, same as any other tall page content — not the chart *itself*
      needing an internal scrollbar, which is what was actually promised earlier).
    - `fullscreen` (`ChordCharts.tsx`'s "maximize" toggle, `PageFit`'s `fitHeight={true}` mode):
      here there genuinely is a fixed box (the full-screen overlay) with no "page below" to grow
      into, so this mode keeps fitting *both* dimensions at once, exactly as before — the chart
      still always fits with no scrolling, just inside whatever the screen's actual shape is
      rather than a paper ratio. */

/** Measures its children at their natural (unscaled) size and applies one uniform
    `transform: scale()` so the whole thing — not just one row or one bar — always fits. The same
    "measure, then scale to fit" idea `FitChordRow` below uses for one bar's chord row, applied to
    the entire chart. Two modes (see `ChordChart`'s own comment for why both exist):

    - `fitHeight={true}`: fits *both* width and height inside a fixed box (an ancestor with a real
      size, e.g. the full-screen overlay) — the original behavior, content centered within
      whatever space is left over in the non-binding dimension.
    - `fitHeight={false}`: fits *width only* (always scales to exactly fill the available width,
      up to `MAX_SCALE`) and reports the resulting *height* back onto its own box, so the chart is
      never narrower than its container just because it happens to be tall. Horizontally centered
      (`left-1/2` + `translateX(-50%)`, the same technique `fitHeight={true}` already uses for its
      own centering, just without the vertical half) rather than left-anchored, so hitting the
      `MAX_SCALE` cap in a container wide enough to need it — the common case for
      `ChordChartEditor.tsx`'s own, wider page, rare for the real chart's own `max-w-2xl`-capped
      container — doesn't leave the result sitting flush left with empty space stranded on the
      right.

    Exported for `ChordChartEditor.tsx`'s own bar grid (`fitHeight={false}`, the same mode the
    normal in-page chart view uses) — its bars are fixed-size regardless of which one is currently
    an `<input>`, so the scale factor stays stable while typing; a `transform: scale()` doesn't
    interfere with clicking into or typing in a scaled `<input>` (the browser maps click
    coordinates through the transform correctly on its own). */
