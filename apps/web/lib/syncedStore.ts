/**
 * The shared machinery behind `lib/useSyncedSettings.ts` and `lib/useSyncedTunes.ts` — a
 * module-level, per-key in-memory cache of "the current value while signed in", updated
 * *synchronously* on every local edit and only written to Convex after a short quiet period.
 * Fixes two real problems the first version of the sync hooks had:
 *
 * 1. **A stale-closure race that silently dropped rapid edits.** The original hooks derived
 *    "current value" from the `useQuery` result each render and closed over it in `update()`. Two
 *    edits fired before the first mutation's result round-tripped back through the query both read
 *    the *same* pre-edit snapshot, so the second write clobbered the first instead of building on
 *    it — reported as "jam practice only lets me add one tune at a time" (adding several standards
 *    quickly each read the same stale tune list). Keeping the current value in this synchronous,
 *    always-up-to-date module-level cache — not a value closed over from a stale render — means
 *    every `set` call starts from whatever the *last* call actually left behind, whether or not
 *    Convex has echoed it back yet.
 * 2. **A live network round-trip on every single keystroke/slider-tick/click.** The original
 *    hooks fired a `useMutation` call immediately on every `update()`. Dragging a tempo slider or
 *    typing into a name field could fire dozens of writes a second — reported as the whole site
 *    feeling slow. Now a local edit updates the in-memory cache (and re-renders every subscribed
 *    component) instantly, and only the *last* value in a burst of edits actually gets sent to
 *    Convex, `DEBOUNCE_MS` after the burst goes quiet — one write per pause in editing, not one
 *    per edit.
