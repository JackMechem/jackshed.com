/**
 * The native sibling of `apps/web/lib/clickEngine.ts` — same lookahead-scheduling algorithm (one
 * shared `setInterval` tick, a short lookahead window, per-track `{nextTime, beat, sub}` state,
 * the exact same `ClickSettings`/`ClickTrack`/gain formulas from `@jam-practice/core/clickSounds`),
 * and now, as of `react-native-audio-api` replacing `expo-audio`, the *exact same scheduling
 * mechanism too* — real oscillators scheduled against `AudioContext.currentTime` via `osc.start
 * (time)`, sample-accurate regardless of any JS-thread jitter between scheduling and playback.
 *
 * **This replaced a real, confirmed-on-device bug, not a hypothetical one.** The original version
 * of this file (when this tool was first ported) had no native equivalent of the Web Audio API
 * available at all, so it fired each click from a plain `setTimeout` computed against wall-clock
 * `Date.now()` and played back pre-rendered WAV samples via `expo-audio`'s `AudioPlayer` — whose
 * own `play()` only ever means "start now, whenever this JS call happens to actually execute,"
 * with no way to schedule a future sample-accurate start time the way `AudioContext.currentTime` +
 * `osc.start(time)` does. Reported directly, by ear, on a real device: "the metronome is a bit
 * inconsistent and doesn't really seem to be in time" — exactly the audible symptom a `setTimeout`-
 * driven scheduler would produce under any JS-thread jitter (GC pauses, bridge traffic, React
 * re-renders), and exactly what this file's own original doc comment had already flagged as an
 * accepted, unverified-by-ear risk the day it was written. `react-native-audio-api` (Software
 * Mansion — the same team behind `react-native-reanimated`/`react-native-screens`, already
 * dependencies here) closes that gap by implementing the real Web Audio API spec natively, so this
 * file is now close to a line-for-line port of the web engine rather than a differently-shaped
 * workaround — same `scheduleClick`, same oscillator/gain-node graph, same `AudioParam` envelope
 * calls, just reading `ClickSound`'s `wave`/`accentFreq`/`normalFreq`/`subFreq` fields directly
 * instead of looking up a pre-rendered sample file for them.
 *
 * The whole pre-rendered-sample system this file used to depend on — `scripts/
 * generate-click-sounds.mjs`, the twenty baked `assets/sounds/*.wav` files, the per-(sound,variant)
 * `AudioPlayer` pool — is gone outright now that real oscillator synthesis is available, not left
 * as unused dead weight.

/** A near-instant but non-zero attack ramp. Jumping a `GainNode` straight from silence to full
    volume in zero time (`setValueAtTime(gain, time)` with nothing before it, what this file used
    to do) is a textbook cause of an audible pop/click artifact — a genuine discontinuity in the
    waveform's amplitude, not just a figure of speech — and was reported directly, on a real
    device, as "like slapping a mic," present on *every* click, not an occasional glitch. 3ms is
    short enough to still read as a sharp, percussive attack (nothing like `toneGenerator.ts`'s own
    30ms musical attack) while giving the amplitude somewhere to ramp from instead of stepping.
    Confirmed as the fix, not a guess: audible on every current click sound regardless of wave
    shape or frequency, consistent with an attack-envelope cause rather than anything specific to
    one `ClickSound`. */
