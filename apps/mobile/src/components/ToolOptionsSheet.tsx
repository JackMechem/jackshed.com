      building this array still re-evaluates on every one of *its own* renders (it's a plain JS
      array literal), but a thunk's body doesn't run until actually invoked, so an inactive tab's
      own expensive work (sorting/filtering a long list, say) never runs at all, and the active
      tab's doesn't run until genuinely needed. Fixes a real, reported bug: a tool with a long list
      behind one of its tabs (Chord Charts' own Library tab, with every imported chart re-sorted
      and re-rendered into JSX on every render) made tapping "Options" itself feel slow — the
      state update that should just reveal the panel also had to finish building that entire list
      first, since a plain `ReactNode` prop is constructed unconditionally. */

/**
 * A generic, reusable "everything but the essentials" panel for a tool screen — per a direct
 * request meant to apply to every tool going forward, not just the Metronome: "the mobile app
 * [should] avoid scrolling on main tool pages... the tool should have the most common options
 * built into the main display... everything else will be in a menu that can be opened with a
 * button somewhere and that menu will have tabs for the different sections."
 *
 * A tool screen's own job under this pattern: show only its handful of most-reached-for controls
 * directly (for the Metronome — time signature, tempo, the beat indicator, Start/Stop), sized to
 * fit one screen with no `ScrollView` at all, plus one button that opens this sheet for everything
 * else, grouped into tabs (`ToolOptionsTab[]`, one tab per logical section — "Meter," "Sound,"
 * ...). A tool with only one real options group can pass a single tab; the tab row itself only
 * renders when there's more than one, so that case doesn't show a pointless single-tab row.
 *
 * Deliberately a hand-built `Modal` + `Pressable` backdrop + sliding panel, not a native bottom
 * sheet (`@expo/ui`'s own `BottomSheet`, or React Navigation's `formSheet` presentation) — the same
 * "fully native components tend to look very generic" steer the rest of this app's redesign
 * already followed. Each tab's own content scrolls independently inside the sheet (a `ScrollView`
 * per active tab) — "avoid scrolling" was specifically about the *main* tool page, not about
 * secondary options, which are expected to scroll like any normal settings panel once there's more
 * than a screen's worth.
