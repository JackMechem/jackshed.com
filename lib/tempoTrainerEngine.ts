/**
 * Tempo Trainer's click-scheduling engine and running state. Deliberately built as a close mirror
 * of `lib/metronomeEngine.ts` — full meter/subdivision settings, the "tempo note value" BPM
 * conversion, and the same "structure" (chained, differently-metered sections) feature, all
 * handled exactly the same way — per a direct request that this tool's own metronome be identical
 * to the plain Metronome's, with only the mute cycle layered on top as something extra, not a
 * simplified metronome with the mute cycle bolted onto it. Same plain, module-level-state shape
 * for the same reason as that file: nothing here is tied to any component's mount lifecycle, so
 * the click (or the silent counting through a muted stretch) keeps running across a page
 * navigation. `components/TempoTrainer.tsx` is just a view: push settings in whenever they
 * change, read the live snapshot back out via `useSyncExternalStore`.
 *
 * The one thing this tool adds on top of a plain metronome: it alternates between a stretch of
 * `onBars` audible bars and a stretch of `offBars` silent ones, looping that on/off cycle for as
 * long as it's running — a trainer for holding a tempo internally once the click disappears,
 * rather than a metronome you're meant to listen to the whole time. The mute-cycle phase and the
 * structure's own section/bar advance are tracked independently (both keyed off the same
 * `beat === 0 && sub === 0` "a new bar just started" tick, the same detection
 * `lib/metronomeEngine.ts`'s own structure advance already uses) — a structure section's bars and
 * the mute cycle's on/off bars are two unrelated things counting at once, not one driving the
 * other. Reuses `lib/clickEngine.ts`'s generic `startClickEngine` exactly the way
 * `lib/metronomeEngine.ts` does (one track, `getSettings`/`onBeat`); the muted bars aren't a
 * second code path or a paused engine — they're the *same* click track, just handed an all-zero
 * `accents`/`subAccents` for those bars, so `startClickEngine`'s own per-tick logic schedules no
 * sound at all (an all-zero `BeatLevel` already means "no click," the same as a muted beat/tick
 * anywhere else in this app).
