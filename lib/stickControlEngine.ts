/**
 * This drum warmup tool's click-scheduling/playback engine — a plain module with no React, the
 * same shape `lib/metronomeEngine.ts` and `lib/metricModulationEngine.ts` already use so a tool's
 * audio keeps running across page navigation (nothing here is tied to any component's mount
 * lifecycle). `components/StickControl.tsx` is just a view: push settings in whenever they
 * change, read the live snapshot back out via `useSyncExternalStore`.
 *
 * Unlike those two, this doesn't go through `lib/clickEngine.ts`'s generic `startClickEngine` —
 * that engine's `ClickSettings` only knows "which beat/sub am I on," not "which hand is this
 * stroke, and which repeat of the 4-bar phrase am I on, and should I count off first" — all of
 * which this tool needs for the "distinct click per hand" option and for knowing when a repeat
 * count (or the whole pattern) is finished. So this is its own small scheduler, built the same
 * way (a single `setInterval` lookahead loop, borrowing `clickEngine.ts`'s own `scheduleClick`
 * helper and `CLICK_SOUNDS` palette) but with its own tick semantics.
 *
 * Timeline model: a count-off (only before the *first* repeat — one count-off happens once, at
 * the start, not before every loop back to bar 1) of plain beat clicks, then `repeats` passes
 * through the current pattern's bars, walked one *cell* at a time rather than through uniform
 * fixed-duration "slots" — a roll segment's cells are played at double speed (16th notes) or, for
 * the "Triplets" roll type, a third of a beat each (8th-note triplets) — see `lib/stickControl.ts`'s
 * own `NoteCell`/`CellSpeed`/`CELL_BEAT_FRACTION` — so a bar's cells no longer all take the same
 * amount of time the way they did before that was added, and the schedule has to be built
 * cell-by-cell to reflect that rather than by dividing a bar into equal slots.
